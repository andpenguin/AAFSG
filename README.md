This is a seed filter for All Advancements speedruns, mostly designed for Pogloot

The filter looks through minecraft seeds for one that contains the following criteria:

Desert Temple close to 0,0
A Fortress and Bastion within 10 chunks of each other and of 0,0
A Pillager Outpost for How Did We Get Here within 500 blocks of 0,0

# How to use the filter

Big thanks to Denry, DylanDC14, and ExerSolver for helping with the project, and T_Wagz for playing it in Beta!

Also, this project could not exist without the work of Neil and KaptainWutax in creating the seedfinding libraries.
